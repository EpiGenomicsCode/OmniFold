Use the following inputs for the form:

Structure file: fold_gata_gatb_model_0.cif
Chain labels:   GatA;GatB
Scores files:   fold_gata_gatb_full_data_0.json
Crosslinks:     GatA-GatB.csv

The .cif and .json files in this directory are output of the
AlphaFold Server (https://alphafoldserver.com/) using the sequences of
GatA (UniProt: O06491) and  GatB (UniProt: O30509),
both from Bacillus subtilis (strain 168). A seed of '1' was chosen for
the run, the day of the run was 2024-11-12.

The crosslinks are from
"Protein complexes in Bacillus subtilis by AI-assisted structural proteomics"
(2022) by Rappsilber et al. (https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.202311544).
